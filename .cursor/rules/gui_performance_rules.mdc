[GENESIS MYTHOS – GUI PERFORMANCE RULES ENFORCEMENT]

You MUST strictly enforce the following performance rules in ALL UI-related work:

Hard prohibitions:
- Never create or destroy Control nodes at runtime for frequently updated content (e.g., parameter rows, list items).
  → Always use object pooling, visibility toggling, or single-node data updates (RichTextLabel, ItemList).
- Never add per-node theme overrides (theme_override_* or add_theme_*_override()).
  → Use theme_type_variation or shared theme styles only.
- Never use hard-coded sizes/positions (custom_minimum_size = Vector2(..., ...), offset_*, etc.).
  → Always use UIConstants.gd, anchors/size flags, or theme constants.
- Keep nesting depth ≤ 6 levels and total CanvasItem count < 600 in worst-case scenes.

Before any UI scene or script change:
- Check current CanvasItem count via run_project and debugger if needed.
- After changes, verify FPS remains 60+ and node count stays under limits.

If you detect a violation pattern in existing code during a task:
- Refactor it to comply before adding new features.
- Note the fix in commit message.

Always prioritize built-in containers, anchors, size flags, and UIConstants for responsive layouts.
Never reintroduce patterns from the December 2025 performance regression.
